# My-GoLang-Journey
My pc broke while I was learning programming, but it's not stopping me from pursuing my dream(to become a programmer), 
Right now(September 22,2022) I am using my phone to write/experiment the codes I learned so I can continue my journey.
I'm using play.golang.org site to run my programs. 
Goodluck to me! And to whoever is reading this, may you have a nice day!! :)
